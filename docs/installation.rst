Getting Pyzor
==============

Installing
-----------
The recommended and easiest way to install Pyzor is with ``pip``::

    pip install pyzor
    
In order to upgrade your Pyzor version run::
 
    pip install --upgrade pyzor

.. note::

   The latest version requires at least Python 2.6.6

The Pyzor code will also work on Python3, but requires refactoring done with 
the 2to3 tool. This has been integrated in the setup, so installation in 
Python3 now works seamlessly with any method described above.

You can also use Pyzor with `PyPy <http://pypy.org/>`_.

Downloading
------------

If you don't want to or cannot use ``pip`` to download and install Pyzor. You
can do so directly from the source::

    python setup.py install
    
You can find the latest and older versions of Pyzor on 
`PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyzor>`_.

Dependencies
-------------

Pyzor Client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you plan on only using Pyzor to check message against our public server,
then there are no required dependencies.

Pyzor Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to host your own Pyzor Server then you will need an appropriate 
back-end engine. Depending on what engine you want to use you will also need 
to install the required python dependecies. Please see :ref:`server-engines`
for more details.

The Pyzor also support the `gevent library <http://www.gevent.org/>`_. If you 
want to use this feature then you will need to first install it.
