Configuration
===============

The format of this file is INI-style (name=value, divided into [sections]). 
Names are case insensitive. All values which are filenames can have shell-style 
tildes (~) in them. All values which are relative filenames are interpreted to 
be relative to the Pyzor homedir. All of these options can be overridden by 
command-line arguments.

It is recommended to use the provided `sample configuration <https://github.co
m/SpamExperts/pyzor/blob/master/config/config.sample>`_. Simply copy it in 
pyzor's ``homedir``, remove the ``.sample`` from the name and alter any 
configurations you prefer.
